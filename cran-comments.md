## Updated in this version

* Expanded description field that explains Chart.js and provides a link

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.2.3
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.2.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
* A message in the win-builder check mentions the title including Chart.js as a possible spelling mistake. As I understand it this is how the library name is formatted on the [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org) website.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
